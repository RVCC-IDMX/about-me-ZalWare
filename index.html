            <h2> A Clockwork Orange</h2>
            <div>
                I jumped, O my brothers, and I fell on the sidewalk hard, but I
                did not snuff it, oh no. If I had snuffed it I would not be here
                to write what I written have. It seems that the jump was not
                from a big enough heighth to kill. But I cracked my back and
                my wrists and nogas and felt very bolshy pain before I passed
                out, brothers, with astonished and surprised litsos of chello-
                vecks in the streets looking at me from above. And just before
                I passed out I viddied clear that not one chelloveck in the
                whole horrid world was for me and that that music through
                the wall had all been like arranged by those who were sup-
                posed to be my like new droogs and that it was some veshch
                like this that they wanted for their horrible selfish and boast-
                ful politics. All that was in like a million millionth part of one
                minoota before I threw over the world and the sky and the
                litsos of the staring chellovecks that were above me.
                Where I was when I came back to jeezny after a long black
                black gap of it might have been a million years was a hospital,
                all white and with this von of hospitals you get, all like sour
                and smug and clean. These antiseptic veshches you get in hos-
                pitals should have a real horrorshow von of like frying
                onions or of flowers. I came very slow back to knowing who
                I was and I was all bound up in white and I could not feel
                anything in my plott, pain nor sensation nor any veshch at all.
                All round my gulliver was a bandage and there were bits of
                stuff like stuck to my litso, and my rookers were all in
                bandages and like bits of stick were like fixed to my fingers like
                on it might be flowers to make them grow straight, and my
                poor old nogas were all straightened out too, and it was all
                bandages and wire cages and into my right rooker, near the
                pletcho, was red red krovvy dripping from a jar upside down.
                But I could not feel anything, O my brothers. There was a
                nurse sitting by my bed and she was reading some book that
                was all very dim print and you could viddy it was a story
                because of a lot of inverted commas, and she was like breath-
                ing hard uh uh uh over it, so it must have been a story about
                the old in-out in-out. She was a real horrorshow devotchka,
                this nurse, with a very red rot and like long lashes over her
                glazzies, and under her like very stiff uniform you could viddy
                she had very horrorshow groodies. So I said to her: "What
                gives, O my little sister? Come thou and have a nice lay-down
                with your malenky droog in this bed."
